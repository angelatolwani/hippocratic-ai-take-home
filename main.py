Before submitting the assignment, describe here in a few sentences what you would have built next if you spent 2 more hours on this project:

If I had two more hours, I'd probably focus on a few things to make the experience feel more complete. Here are some ideas:
- Add more complete story templates: I'd include a wider range of built-in templates for different vibes, or maybe try prompting the model 
to come up with custom templates based on what the user asks for.
- Track user feedback: I'd set up a db to track whether someone liked or disliked the story, and store that along with the original 
prompt and any edits they chose. That way, the system could start to learn what kinds of stories or suggestions people respond to most.
- Safety checks: I might add some content filters or run the story through another judge focused on safety, to make sure themes and language
are appropriate for the target age range.
- Build a simple frontend: I built this as a CLI app, but I'd add a lightweight frontend, maybe something with a night sky background, a 
typewriter / read aloud effect for the story, and thumbs up/down buttons, just to make it feel more like a bedtime story app and less like a script.
